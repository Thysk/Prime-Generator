# Prime-Generator
A python coded prime number finder. This is a practice piece of work to work on coding practices and develop my understanding.

The user interface is a simple cli menu that allows users to find new primes, or view the list of primes already found.
The program itself uses the sieve of eratosthenes to find primes.
It then writes all the prime numbers to a sqllite3 database.
